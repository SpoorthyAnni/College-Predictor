# College-Predictor
Overview:

The "College Admission Predictor System" is a web-based application designed to assist prospective students in predicting their chances of admission to various colleges based on their demographic and academic details. By analyzing data such as age, gender, race, and location, the system aims to help students make informed decisions and universities to increase diversity and provide equal opportunities.

Project Goals:
Assist Students: Help students shortlist universities where they have a higher chance of admission.
Increase Diversity: Aid universities in promoting diversity by considering demographic factors in admissions.
Inform Decision-Making: Provide insights to students about their admission probabilities, helping them apply to suitable colleges.

Methodology:
Data Collection: Gather past admission records from engineering colleges, including 12th standard marks, entrance exam scores, and student categories.
Data Pre-Processing: Clean and pre-process the data to remove inconsistencies and errors.
Feature Engineering: Select relevant features such as academic scores and demographic information for prediction.
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks.
Model Training: Train the selected model on pre-processed data using supervised learning techniques.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and apply cross-validation and regularization to avoid overfitting.
Model Deployment: Create a user interface for students to input their details and receive admission predictions.
Maintenance and Updating: Regularly update the model with new data to ensure continued accuracy.

Tools and Technologies:
Front End: HTML, CSS
Back End: PHP, SQL
Programming Language: Java

Usage:
Registration: Students register with personal and academic details.
Prediction: The system compares the student’s marks with college cut-offs and demographic data to predict admission chances.
Results: Students receive a list of colleges where they are likely to be admitted.
